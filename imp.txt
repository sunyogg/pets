why am i creating so many unnecessary files (like somthing, catASCII)?

Ah! I am getting confused and having some issues.
So earlier I created a new file 'something' in github and commited the changes
But when i go to local repo and pull the changes, what will happen is :
It'll first sync the commit which are ahead and then create one more commit in order to merge 
them, as if those commit weren't of type fast-forward. So I read this answer on stackoverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62653114/how-can-i-deal-with-this-git-warning-pulling-without-specifying-how-to-reconci
but if follow this thing and do: git pull --ff-only
then it will always abort the pulls that are not fast forward, thus again making things difficult.
isn't there anything that works for both, if merge is fast forward it should simply
merge without creating a new merge, and if pull is not of type fast forward, then
it should promt me for fixing the conflicts.
